Having worked in several industries on the business side, I have made a move to switch my career to become a Full-Stack Developer.  I have been building pc's since I was a kid, and have self-taught myself several programming things because I wanted to change something to my liking.\r\n                </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default AboutMe;","\r\nimport './styles/App.css'\r\nimport AboutMe from './components/AboutMe';\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n    return <AboutMe />;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDom from 'react-dom';\r\nimport App from './App';\r\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\r\nimport './styles/index.css'\r\n\r\nReactDom.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));"],"sourceRoot":""}
