            <h1>Hi, I'm Christopher Franklin.....a Full-Stack Developer</h1>
                <p>I am from Peoria, IL. I attended Bradley University, and received my Bachelor's degree in Business Management and Administration.  I currently live in East Peoria, IL with my amazing wife and two beautiful daughters.  Having worked in several industries on the business side, I have made a move to switch my career to become a Full-Stack Developer.  I have been building pc's since I was a kid, and have self-taught myself several programming things because I wanted to change something to my liking.
